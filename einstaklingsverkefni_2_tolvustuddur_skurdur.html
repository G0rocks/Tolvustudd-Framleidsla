										<h1>Project 2 - Computer aided cuts</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="Verkefni 2-Cuts/final_look.png" alt="The final look of the finished project" /></span>
									<p>This project is all about using cutters, a laser cutter and a vinyl cutter in this case, to create the shapes that you desire.</p>
									<p>Before the project is designed the prerequisite is to perform a self-made kerf test</p>
								
									<h2>Project requirements</h2>
									<p>The project requirements is in 2 parts (in Icelandic are the main design ones, since that's the way I got them and the others are ones I wrote from other places in the project description):</p>
									<lt>
										<li>Notaðu vínylskerann til að búa til eitthvað. 100x50cm skurðarflötur max.</li>
										<li>Hannaðu parametrískt, geirneglt (pressfit) módel af byggingareiningum. Módelið þarf að vera skalanlegt á mismunandi máta (efnisþykkt, hæðir og breiddir sem nemandi velur), útfært með parametríum í hugbúnaði að eigin vali. Mælt er með Autodesk Fusion 360 ef nemandi vill fá aðstoð kennara, en hafi nemandi tök á því að nota t.d. Solidworks eða Rhino 3D + Grasshopper þá er það í lagi.</li>
										<li>Use a laser cutter to cut out your design of a parametric model and build your design.</li>
										<li>Document the entire process of this project on your website</li>
										<li>Perform the prerequisite kerf test</li>
									</lt>
									<br>
									Note: If the design of the laser cut model is made as general building blocks which can be assembled in multiple different ways (similar to <a href="https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/salzberg/week2.html" > this one</a>), you will get bonus points.<br>
									Note: For material, we can only use one piece of the following options
									<lt>
										<li>4mmx500mmx500mm birkikrossviður</li>
										<li>3mmx500mmx500mm akríl (Glært, svart eða hvítt)</li>
										<li>Mögulega fleiri þykktir, tilkynnt síðar</li>
									</lt>

									<h2>Prerequisite - Kerf test</h2>
									<p>
										To do the kerf test we are allowed to do it as a group of 3 so I start by contacting the rest of the class on the discord server to make a group.<br>
										After creating a group with <a href="https://zuzzol.github.io/heimasida/">Ragnar</a> and <a href="https://bjornvir.github.io/index.html">Björn</a> we do the kerf test which is documented <a href="https://bjornvir.github.io/Kerf_test.html">here</a>
									</p>

                  <h2>Part 0 - The idea and design requirements</h2>
									<p>
										Before we start designing (or maybe some would say this is the first step of designing) we must come with an idea and some design requirements for that idea.
										Now it just so happens that I am working on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBUCJX8jSgjNQ84NICpUcm9sq3xlJgyAo">electric cargo ship</a> and for that project we need to maintain some batteries and we need to learn to use solar panels.<br>
										So we have our idea, we are going to make a solar charging station for the batteries to be used in the proof of concept boat.
									</p>
									<p>
										To make this wee ned something that can:
										<ul>
											<li>Hold 5 solar panels (with options to add/remove solar panels)</li>
											<li>Hold at least 1 battery which could be any of the sizes and types that I currently own.</li>
											<li>Have room for connecting wires between the solar panels and the batteries</li>
											<li>Have over voltage protection for the batteries to protect them from damage.</li>
											<li>Have under voltage protection for the batteries to protect them from damage, in case the voltage from the panels becomes too low.</li>
											<li>Be able to adjust the angle of the solar panels</li>
											<li>Require less than or the same as the available material.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h2>Part 1 - The design</h2>
									<p>We first start by sketching a solution.</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 2-Cuts/sketch1.png" alt="The first sketch for project 2" width="1000">
									<p>Where the blue part is the 5 solar panels, the red part is the wiring connecting the solar panels and the battery, the green part is the circuitry protecting the batteries and the black part is the design.</p>
									<p>We talked this design over with the professor and he gave some good pointers. We also talked more about how the objets will attach to each other. We're going to start with the solar panel holder design. Let's make the next iteration of the sketch.</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 2-Cuts/sketch2.png" alt="The second sketch for project 2" width="1000">
									<p>
										The idea has been refined more and looks like it should hold 1 solar panel and the ability to make many of these, side by side, gives it the ability to hold 5 panels.
										There is nothing for the battery, I have decided to do that part later as well as move all the electronics to a different project and only do the mechanical structure that holds the panels in this project.
										This method can angle the solar panels but in order to know how much material it needs we must do some calculations.
									</p>
									<p>
										Note that part 1 is the main part, the solar panel will rest on top of that one (where the 'X' is), the slits in part 1 indicate where the object will bend backwards.
										Part 2 will be put into place on the bottom plate of part 1 and part 4 will enable the structure to stand rigid without falling over. Part 4 sits in the diagonal slits on part 2 to hold up the bendy section of part 1
										and part 5 will be in 3 places on the upper section of part 1 to make sure the solar panel stays in place.
									</p>
									<p>
										We start by attempting to set up a simple box in Freecad (I will be using Freecad in the summer so I'm practicing using that instead of fusion360)
										and move the shape to inkscape in order to laser cut it. After skimping around through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffn1w9xbYp4">this video</a>
										we realise we should install a workbench called LCinterlocking.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 2-Cuts/install_addon.png" alt="Installing LCinterlocking" width="1000">
									
									<p>
										Managing to make a simple rectangle we bump into a scaling problem where the length in inkscape is 61.815mm but the lenght in freecad is 61.46mm.
										Usually the scaling problems I have are more severe than this so we will just rescale our finished export in inkscape to the original size before cutting if it presents itself as a problem.

									<img src="Verkefni 2-Cuts/CAD1.png" alt="CAD 1" width="1000">

									<p>
										We proceed to draw up the design in freecad. Note that the files for this design won't be in the github repository for this page since I plan on using this for a different project the files are stored there, if you want to look at the files, feel free to contact me.

									<h2>Part 2 - Preparing for laser cutting</h2>

									<h2>Part 3 - Tests</h2>


									<h2>Part 4 - Results</h2>

									<h2>Part 5 - Vinyl cut</h2>
									<p>
										As part of this project we are also supposed to make a vinyl cut object.
										My original idea was to make a sticker to put on the solar panel stand alerting people of electricity but after
										talking to a fellow student about how cool the sticker he made for his laptop is I want to make a laptop sticker also.
										The idea is to make a sticker to put where my finger points:
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 2-Cuts/Vinyl cut/stickers_before.jpg" alt="Laptop stickers before" width="1000">

									<p>
										The sticker that I want should be a peace sign which is supposed to be pink as per result of the conversation with my fellow student.
										Now we could make our own sign in inkscape (which sounds cool) but before we do that we'll see if we can find a cool one already made online, that we can use.
										Downloading <a href="https://icon-library.com/icon/peace-icon-png-2.html">this image</a>:
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 2-Cuts/Vinyl cut/peace-icon-png-2.jpg" alt="Downloaded peace icon" width="1000">

									<p>
										We get the thought that we can either make outlines and make the gray on the back of the laptop show through or make a solid peace sign.
										Looking at it using inkscape we see these 2 option
									</p>
