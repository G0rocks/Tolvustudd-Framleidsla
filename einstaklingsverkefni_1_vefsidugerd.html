                  <h2>Part 1 - The setup</h2>
									<p>To setup this webpage we first started by watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU4NWxEpJJumoJghcC5V3rjv0_VHE7IQr">  youtube videos  </a> our teacher, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hafli%C3%B0i-%C3%A1sgeirsson-bb9679120/?originalSubdomain=is" > Hafliði </a> (Needed to google "html how to hyperlink" to figure out how to hyperlink this).</p>
									<p>Ended up looking at templates from <a href="https://html5up.net/" >HTML5up</a> and choosing one called <a href="https://html5up.net/forty" >Forty</a> (which you can probably see by the striking resemblance).</p>
									<p>Once the files for the website were downloaded I set up a <a href="https://github.com/G0rocks/Tolvustudd-Framleidsla" >github repository</a> for the project, backed up the files there and enabled github pages for that repository. To enable github pages I needed to google "how to use github pages" and found out that it's as simple as a switch in the settings for the repository.</p>
									<p>Then I started poking around the files I had just downloaded</p>

                  <h2>Part 2 - Main page</h2>
									<p>At this point I start working on the main page wich is called "index.html".
										I didn't do much except make the contacting form in the footer simpler, change some text to fit me instead of the default "Lorem ipsum" and "Forty by HTML5up" which was everywhere.
										I removed some unnecessary links from the menu to some generic template pages and changed the links on the
									</p>

                  <h2>Part 3 - Project 1 documentation</h2>
									<p>Creating this page was done fairly close to real time with all the other steps meaning I mostly documented what I could while I did it.
										That makes this section of this page relatively small but it's pretty accurate.
										I did not do everything here in the same order as it is documented (some of the fixes were done on the fly as I was working on other parts of the site).
									</p>

									<h2>Part 4 - About me</h2>
									<p>
										I start by making a copy of the landing.html page and call it <a href="/about_me.html" >about me</a>.
										First I take all the "lorem ipsum" type text out and make the page similar to the other pages because I forgot to remove the weird stuff I don't want to use in the footer.
										
									</p>


									<h2>Part 5 - Fixes</h2>
									<p>Here I document smaller fixes of things that make the website just a little bit better"</p>

									<h3>The tab name</h3>
									<p>I noticed the tab name (turns out it's called a title) was a default name from the website developer.</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 1-Vefsíða/weird_tab_name.png" alt="The html title of the website before fixing" height="250">
									<p>So after totally figuring out by myself how to fix it *cough* sarcasm *cough cough*</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 1-Vefsíða/how_to_set_tab_name.png" alt="Google results for 'how to set tab name'" height="250">
									<p>The tab name was fixed (as you can probably tell ^_^)</p>
									<p>Oh and to insert the images for this fix I had to google that wich also allowed me to insert all the other images on this page.</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 1-Vefsíða/html_insert_image.png" alt="Google results for 'html insert image'" height="250">

									<h3>Weird images</h3>
									<p>After inserting some images I loaded the page and they were all wonky</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 1-Vefsíða/weird_images.png" alt="Shows wonky images on this page" height="250">
									<p>I attempted to fix this by removing the "width" attribute in the lines where I insert images but because the github page takes so long to implement the changes (and I can't seem to figure out how to view images in the html preview on my local machine) I googled "html image scale aspect ratio" and got a grepper response saying "Don't set height AND width. Use one or the other and the correct aspect ratio will be maintained.". Feeling confident, a couple of minutes later the images turned out fine.</p>

									<h3>Tab icon</h3>
									<p>I noticed the other tabs in my browser had a tab icon so I wanted one too and I grabbed the one I made for my 
										<a href="https://hul-dar.is/" > other website</a> and put the same one on this website.
										Had to google "html how to add title icon" and found results <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-icon-logo-in-title-bar-using-html/" > here</a>.</p>
