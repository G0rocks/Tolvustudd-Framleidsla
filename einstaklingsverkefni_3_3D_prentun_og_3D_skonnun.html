										<h1>Project 3 - Additive manufacturing</h1>
									</header>
									<p>
										This project is all about designing and 3D printing something that you can not manufacture using a 3-axis milling machine and scanning an object in 3D.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/additive_manufacturing.jpg" alt="Additive manufacturing" /></span>
                  <h2>Part 0 - Test</h2>
									<p>
										Before starting we are supposed to to a test to see the capabilities of the printer. The test can be done in 3 person groups and is documented <a href="einstaklingsverkefni_3_3D_prentunartest.html">here</a>.
									</p>
                  <h2>Part 1 - Idea</h2>
									<p>
										Firstly, for the 3D printing project we need to know what we're designing, we need an <u>idea</u>. After thinking for a while and cleaning the house and thinking some more, we get the idea to make a broom handle for the broom at home, see image below.
										You see, the thing is, ever since we got this broom the blue handle at the top has been slowly falling off and last year I taped it to the broomstick but the tape fell off too not long ago so we need this fixed.
										We need:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li> A way to make the handle stay put without damaging/removing material (this is additive manufacturing)</li>
										<li> The handle to be strong enough to handle (heh, see what I did there) the load </li>
										<li> A good grip for the hand </li>
										<li> To be able to 3D print our solution </li>
										<li> The solution to be safe (no sharp edges or similar) </li>
										<li> Bonus: If we can make the handle comfortable </li>
									</ul>
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/the broom at home.jpg" alt="The broom at home" height="250">									
									<p>
										Not thinking about the design requirements, our first idea is to drill a hole through the current handle and the broomstick, put a bolt through there and a nut on the other side, tighten and done.
										But that won't work, since it's not additive. Our second idea, this time considering the requirements, uses a clamping mechanism, similar to the one you see on hand brakes on bikes, see image below, this clamping mechanism will attach to the broomstick.
									</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/bike brake levers.jpg" alt="Bike brake levers" height="250">
									<p>
										After getting this idea approved by the professor, we move on to the next step og the project.
									</p>

                  <h2>Part 2 - Design</h2>
									<p>
										We have our design requirements outlined above and start our design. Making the first sketch there are only 2 things that I'm concerned about and they are how to print this (though I think printing it upside down would be best)
										and if the clamping will break the plastic when it connects to the upper portion of the device.
									</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/skissa_1.jpg" alt="Skissa 1" height="250">
									<p>
										On thingiverse, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:243633">here</a>, there is a solution
										to the problem of the clamping which is difficult to implement in our case because of a different orientation.
									</p>
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/clamp_thingiverse_solution.png" alt="Skissa 1" height="250">
									<p>
										Well, no time to waste so we start modeling. We're using the program Freecad to draw, not fusion360 even though that program is really cool, because
										this summer I need to use freecad so I might as well practice now. I won't bore you with the details of the drawing in text but here are some screenshots.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/CAD_2.png" alt="CAD 2" height="250">
									
									<p>
										Of course to make the dimensions correct we had to measure the actual broomstick.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Skidmal_maeling.jpg" alt="Measuring broomstick diameter" height="250">

									<p>
										And then we estimated all the other dimensions such as how far down the shaft of the broom the design needs to go for good grip,
										how wide my hand is (though I kind of knew that) and such, setting all the dimensions up in Freecad.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/spreadsheet.png" alt="Dimensions spreadsheet Freecad" height="250">

									<p>
										When the design was finished it was time to go to manufacturing.
									</p>

                  <h2>Part 3 - Manufacturing</h2>
									<p>
										After finishing the design we bring it into ultimaker cura (the slicer) to set the required settings and export the gcode file to the printer when we realise
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_1.png" alt="Cura 1 - Too big" height="250">

									<p>
										We totally forgot to include the height of the 3D printer build volume (which is 120mm) as a design constraint.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/facepalm-epic.gif" alt="Epic facepalm" height="250">

									<p>
										This was a quick fix though since we could just alter the distance traveled along the broomstick in the freecad spreadsheet and a moment later we had ourselves a design that fit into the printers build volume.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/cura_2_fix.png" alt="Fixing the size of the shaft length" height="250">
									
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_3.png" alt="Cura 3 - Just right" height="250">

									<p>
										Originally we set the layer height to 0.175mm, the infill to 20% and add build plate adhesion (since we have a towering print).
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_4.png" alt="Cura 4 - Base settings" height="250">

									<p>
										The feeling arises that this infill won't be enough since this will be used for a while so we increase it to 40% and the whole thing becomes really dense, we didn't notice at the time but the slicer switched from a grid infill to lines.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_5.png" alt="Cura 5 - More infill and lines not a grid" height="250">

									<p>
										Though soon after we realised and switched to the grid again.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_6.png" alt="Cura 6 - Grid infill" height="250">

									<p>
										Looking at the brim we realise that it's awfully small so just to err on the side of too much stability rather than not enough we increase the number of rounds in the brim to 25.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_7.png" alt="Cura 7 - 25 Lines of brim" height="250">

									<p>
										This results in an estimated print time of 4 hours and 10 minutes using around 40g of filament or 13.31m.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_8.png" alt="Cura 8 - Print time and material used" height="250">

									<p>
										The temperature settings are 205°C for the hot end and 65°C as per the recommendation of the filament producer.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Cura_9.png" alt="Cura 9 - Temperatures" height="250">

									<p>
										To be able to tighten the slit gap in the design we went and bought a bolt and a nut... Yes we only bought one of each... Yes it was hilarious.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1821.HEIC" alt="Nuts" height="250">
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1822.HEIC" alt="Bolts" height="250">
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1824.PNG" alt="Total price" height="250">
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1833.HEIC" alt="Bolt and nut" height="250">
									
									<p>
										The print time for the shaft was a little longer than the slicer estimated (which is normal for this printer) or around 4 hours and 39 minutes.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1831.HEIC" alt="Print done" height="250">

									<p>
										Removing the brim the top (this was printed upside down) is a little bit rough around the edges but we can fix that with some sanding.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1835.HEIC" alt="Removed brim" height="250">
									
									<h2>Part 4 - Assembly</h2>
									<p>
										It fits perfectly, looks like you almost don't need the tightening slit.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1836.PNG" alt="Fit" height="250">
									
									<p>
										When putting the bolt into the hole I realise that a 0.2mm tolerance might have been a little too tight because I had to thread the bolt but it's totally fine. Used <a href="https://convertio.co/mov-gif/">this website</a> to convert a video to a gif to be able to insert this here below.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1839.gif" alt="Threading bolt gif" height="250">									

									<p>
										The final result is very sturdy and comfortable, seems strong enough, is actually quite comfortable and has a good grip.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/print_myndir/IMG_1840.HEIC" alt="Assembled" height="250">									

									<h2>Part 4 - 3D scan</h2>
									<p>
										It is now time to do the 3D scan which we will do using an app called <a href=https://www.qlone.pro/>Qlone</a>
									</p>
									The app requires you to print out a piece of paper with some specific print which we do after receiving it via email.
									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Scan/qlone_mat_email.png" alt="3D scan paper email" height="250">									

									<p>
										First we try scanning my glasses just to get a feel for the app. Using the app you need to move your phone around the object on the piece of paper (without crumpling the paper).
										Meanwhile slowly you build a 3D scan model of the scan.
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Scan/Photos-001/IMG_1871.PNG" alt="3D scanning glasses" height="250">

									<p>
										After scanning the glasses I accidentally deleted the file but that's okay since we were just messing around anyway ^_^
										Next up the plan is to scan the 3D printed broomstick handle and compare the scan to the 3D model I made. This is the result I got:
									</p>

									<img src="Verkefni 3-3D printing/Scan/Photos-001/IMG_1875.GIF" alt="3D scan broomstick handle" height="250">									

									<p>
										It turns out you need to pay for some premium package to be able to export a 3D model from Qlone so we just export a gif instead.
										All in all, you can see the scan captures the general shape of the object but does not notice the slit that allows for the tightening around the broomstick shaft.
										Perhaps using this 3D scan technology could be useful for seeing if something that is a little bit oddly shaped fits into  a device you are modeling though I think that with current technology you would probably be better of modeling an approcimate shape in CAD rather than scanning the object. That way you would save time I think.
